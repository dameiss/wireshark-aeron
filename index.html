		<h3>Wireshark Dissector for the Aeron Protocol</h3>

		<p>The <a href="https://github.com/real-logic/Aeron">Aeron</a> protocol is being developed by Real Logic.
		At <a href="http://www.kaazing.com">Kaazing</a>,
		we are in the process of developing a Wireshark dissector for Aeron.
		For the time being,
		the dissector is only available as a plugin module.
		At some point in the (hopefully near) future,
		the plan is to contribute the dissector code to the <a href="http://www.wireshark.org">Wireshark</a> project for inclusion in Wireshark itself.</p>

		<p>As the dissector is being developed and built against the development (1.99.x) branch of Wireshark, you will need to download the latest <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#development_release">development build</a> for your platform.</p>

		<p>At this time, only Linux 64-bit, Mac OSX 64-bit, and Windows 64-bit plugin modules are provided.
		Please don't ask for support for a different platform, or an earlier release of Wireshark.</p>

		<p>The current dissector plugin version is 0.3.0.</p>
